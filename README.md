# fullstack-learning-journey  
Tracking my progress and projects as I learn full-stack development  

Hey! Everyone, from today I am starting my journey as a full-stack web developer.  

I originally wanted to become a *Cybersecurity Analyst*, but the market demands certifications like OSCP, CompTIA Security+, CEH, etc., and I currently donâ€™t have the funds for them. So, Iâ€™m starting with full-stack development to build skills, fund those certifications in the future, and then pivot to cybersecurity.  

First, build systems. Then, break and protect systems. ðŸ’»ðŸ”’

### Why Iâ€™m posting here and not LinkedIn
- LinkedIn feels too polished and corporate for daily, raw learning updates.  
- I want to post honestly, day-by-day: what I learned, what sucked, and what I built.  
- This repo will serve as my personal *learning journal*, visible to anyone, including recruiters, without the fluff of social media.  

Follow along if you want to see a raw, honest, full-stack learning journey in real-time.
