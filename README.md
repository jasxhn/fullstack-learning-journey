Tracking my progress and projects as I learn full-stack development

Hey! Everyone from today I am starting my journey as a fullstack web developer. 
I wanted to become a *cybersecurity Analyist* but because the market demands OSCP, Comptia security+, CEH etc certifications and i don't have any funds for funding these certs of mine so i am starting fullstack development.
I will fund these certs in near future and pivot to cybersec for sure. Let see what we can make in Fullstack.
First build systems, them break and protect systems.
